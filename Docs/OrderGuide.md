# Component buying guide

### Prerequisites

None! Just know that buying components for [Aliexpress](aliexpress.com) is the cheapest way to get electronics but sinces it often comes by boat, it will most likely take over 2 weeks to arrive. [Amazon](amazon.com) on the other hand, might take less than a week but is **SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE**. The price estimates in the price section are very, very loose. Shopping on aliexpress is kind off an art in of itself at this point. If you wish to find cheaper parts. Here's one tip that will make it much easier : just pick "choice" items. You get free shipping if the order is over 10$ (it will be) When arriving at the cart, verify that you have all the items you need and verify each of them for shipping fees, they can slip in sometimes, be carefull. On the front of scams, I haven't encountered any yet.

### Tools

For this build, you'll need : 

- A 3d printer (I use an ender 3 pro, Very worth for the price)
- A soldering kit (Literally any cheap one will do, if you have more money, Look around for separated higher qualitie items but I don't suggest investing in good stuff since the cheap stuff will last you long and be absolutly fine. If you do want the higher quality stuff, you'll need to buy a solder wick or pump and a solder cleanning spunge or brass ball)
- Solder (**DO NOT USE THE ONE PROVIDED WITH THE KIT** from my experience, its shit (its ok if you're really on a budget but do at your own risk). I'd reccomend buying it separatly, make sure its lead free(ideally) and that it has a good % of flux - I use 2%. Also, the size should be ~ 0.5mm - 1mm)
    
Optional but nice to have : 

- Helping hand (NO NEED TO BUY, you can made ones out of laundry clips or just 3d print 1)
- Flux (idk, in case you have a solder with few of it or if u wanna make em better and prettier)

### **IF YOU'RE HESITANT ON BUYING A 3D PRINTER :**

In my oppinion, every single person on this earth should own one. For all the shitty plastic gadget you buy for whatever reason, theres an INSANE transportation pollution and monetary cost associated. Its all imported from china and NOT AT ALL space efficient. Owning a 3d printer allows you to localise the manifacturing for plastic recyclable usefull parts that you can design yourself. It allows you to repair expensive stuff that really only needs a tiny tiny plastic part to function that the manifacturer won't provide. It allows you to make a whole ass organisation system for every aspect of your life - Checkout gridfinity. If you are passionate about music making and broke, chances are buying a 300 CAD printer will allow you to make multiple instruments costing 100 CAD but as good if not more than 599 CAD consumer versions (The synth/midi community is kinda getting riped off lol).

**If you still don't want to, you can always send the parts to be printed to places [like pcbway](pcbway.com) or a local FAB(Fabrication places(they have 3d printers, cnc stuff, solder kits, etc... all for rent))**

### The pcb

There are 2 main platforms for ordering pcb's : jlcpcb and pcbway. From what It says online, jlcpcb.com is the better platform for pcb's. So go to jlcpcb.com, scroll down and "add gerber files" go to the folder you downloaded -> PCB -> "ThisIsTheGerber.zip". You do not need to extract it. You cannot purchase more than 5 pcb's sooo, make some for your friends or sell them or something. Here are the only settings you might want to change : PCB Color (carefull with that, the price might fluctuate per demand), Surface finish (Pick LeadFree, Its very slightly harder to solder, very slightly more expensive but doesn't contain lead so more environement friendly). Then, select your shippement option and build time and done.

**A PCB-LESS VERSION MIGHT BE DESIGNED**
