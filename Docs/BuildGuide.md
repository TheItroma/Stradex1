# Build guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Stradex1 Beginner Build Guide! A guide meant for absolute begginers who never build a FOSH (Free and Open Source Hardware) project, people who want a [parts list](OrderGuide.md) or just are missing a few details. This project is the equivalent of if a mandolin(if a guitard and violin had a baby), a violin and a otamatone had a baby.

P.S : If there are anything that seem wrong (missinformation or outated links) or that you don't understand with this guide, please, please, make an [issue](#123). Also, this guide was made by a random contributor and bassically an addapted version of the Cheapino keyboard building guide made by [Tompi](https://github.com/tompi) and claude tho I did not use ai for this one.

## Step 0 : Downloading this repository

What is a repository? A repository is, in the FOSS/FOSH world what contains all the files for the project in question.

To download it, simply click [here](https://github.com/Blyn-code/Stradex1/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the zip file wherever you want

## **How to use this guide :**

Using this guide is very simple : 

- First, we'll order the components and make sure we have the tools to make this thing
- Then, we'll 3d print the nessesary parts
- After that, assembly which is devided in 3 sections :

    1. General assembly
    2. Soldering and/or wiring
    3. Finalisation

Once you finish one section, you can go to the next step by clicking the text at the bottom.

So first step : aquire the components and tools.
