- [Calibrate it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPAXeBuq9qU) (not nessesary but worth it if you plan on using your printer often and for other projects)


### Slicing

Open the folder you downloaded and go to the "3DFiles" subfolder.

Open [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/#downloads), make sure you configured the settings before hand like shown in the "Setup your 3d printer" guide.

TODO : BUNCH OF SCREENSHOTS

TODO : SOMETHING SOMETHING SUPPORTS

### Printing

Now just copy the sliced file to a MicroSD card, eject it and insert it into the printer and print.
