# Build guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Stradex1 Beginner Build Guide! A guide meant for absolute begginers who never build a FOSH (Free and Open Source Hardware) project, people who want a [parts list](OrderGuide.md) or just are missing a few details. This project is the equivalent of if a mandolin(if a guitard and violin had a baby), a violin and a otamatone had a baby.

P.S : If there are anything that seem wrong or that you don't understand with this guide, please, please, make an issue. Also, this guide was made by a random contributor and bassically an addapted version of the Cheapino keyboard building guide made by [Tompi](https://github.com/tompi) and claude tho I did not use ai for this one.

First step : Aquire the components and tools : [Ordering Guide](OrderingGuide.md)

Once all of the components arrived, time to aquire the few prerequisites requiered to make this thing. You can click on each of them for a separate guide.

So, you'll need to :

- [Setup your 3d printer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-Z3GmM20JM) (if not done already)
- [Calibrate it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPAXeBuq9qU) (not nessesary but heavely recommended)
