# Stradex1 Component buying guide

## Tools

For this build, you'll need : 

    - A 3d printer
    - A soldering iron
    - Solder (Do make sure that you are getting one with a good ratio of solder material and flux)
    - Solder wick or pump
    - Solder cleanning spunge or brass ball
    
    Optional but nice to have : 

        - Helping hand (NO NEED TO BUY, you can made ones out of laundry clips or just 3d print 1)
        - Flux (idk, in case you have a solder with few of it or if u wanna make em better and prettier)

## The pcb

There are 2 main platforms for ordering pcb's : jlcpcb and pcbway. From what It says online, jlcpcb.com is the better platform for pcb's. So go to jlcpcb.com, scroll down and "add gerber files" go to the folder you downloaded -> SDX_gerbers -> The latest zip file (idk why he has multiple versions considering github exists but oh well). You do not need to extract it. You cannot select more than 5 pcb's sooo, make some for ur friends or sell them or smth. Here are the only settings you might want to change : PCB Color (carefull with that, the price might fluctuate per demand), Surface finish (Pick LeadFree, Its very slightly harder to solder, very slightly more expensive but doesn't contain lead so more environement friendly). Then, select your shippement option and build time and done.

A PCB-LESS VERSION MIGHT BE MADE
